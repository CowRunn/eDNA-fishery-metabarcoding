# eDNA fishery metabarcoding
This is the directory in which the data and scripts associated with the study <i> Nanopore environmental DNA sequencing of catch water for estimating species composition in demersal bottom trawl fisheries </i> 
is located. We used eDNA metabarcoding from catch water to estimate the species composition of ten fishing hauls targeting <i>Nephrops norvegicus</i> (Norway lobster) and roundfish (e.g. Atlantic cod) in the Skagerrak (North-East Atlantic, ICES subdivision 20).
The raw data are available at SRA under Bioporject (to add). The raw reads were analysed as explained in script_eDNA_reads. The results of the taxonomic assignment can be found in the Data folder, alongside other data needed for the statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted in R  and detailed in scripts 1-10.
