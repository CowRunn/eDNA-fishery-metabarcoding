# eDNA-fishery-metabarcoding
This is the directory in which the data and scripts associated with the study <i> Nanopore environmental DNA sequencing of catch water for estimating species composition in demersal bottom trawl fisheries </i> 
is located. We used eDNA metabarcoding from catch water to estimate the species composition of ten fishing hauls targeting <i>Nephrops norvegicus</i> (Norway lobster) and roundfish (e.g. Atlantic cod) in the Skagerrak (North-East Atlantic, ICES subdivision 20).
The fastq files can be found at SRA (to add).
